flight-muscles is a repository of experimental design and analysis scripts devoted to the study of the drosophila flight steering muscle system. 

The project is organized into three parts:

./analysis contains notes, scripts, and workbooks related to both processing and extraction of meta-data as well as files related to experimental design since these two activities are highly interdependent.

./packages contains a copy of the external dependencies for the project beyond those included in the the enthought python distribution. A later version of the project will migrate all dependencies to an external package manager, however this approach provides minimal portability for the time beeing. 

./src contains the non-third party general-purpose functions used by the scripts in ./analysis.
