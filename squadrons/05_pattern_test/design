Experiments intended to identify artifacs associated with the epifl. imaging light. Subsequent analysis identified a left-right assymetry in the response to roll type stimuli.

The following flies were presented the stimulus set on while the imaging light was on at ~2mW/mm^2. The data from these trials are recorded in the trial1 .abf file.

Fly0182,Fly0183,Fly0184,
Fly0185,Fly0186,Fly0187,
Fly0189,Fly0191,Fly0192,
Fly0193,Fly0194,Fly0195,
Fly0196,Fly0197

A subset of these flies :
Fly0191,Fly092,Fly093,
Fly094,Fly096,Fly097 

Were presented the stimulus set both with the imaging light-on and with the imaging light off. The trial2 .abf files contain the the light-off data.
